# ontove_archeo
This ontological module is devised for the description of Archaeological Cultural Heritage items and is called OntoVE_Archeo. It reuses the top-level ontology CIDOC-CRM, v. 7.1.2 (Bekiari et al. 2022) and the finer-grained ontology ArCo-Architettura della Conoscenza, developed by Carriero et al. (2019) in collaboration with the ICCD (http://www.iccd.beniculturali.it/) and CNR (https://www.cnr.it/). 
The ontological module was created within the project OntoVE- Ontologies for the description of Germanic Cultural Heritage in Veneto within the perspective of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The project has as its goal the development of ontological modules for the description of Germanic Cultural Heritage (CH) items related to the Veneto region and provide different visualization outputs designed for both an academic and a non-academic audience. The project is being carried out at Caâ€™ Foscari university of Venice, in close collaboration with a partner IT company, Net7 (https://www.netseven.it/). It is funded by the Italian National Operational Programme (PON, http://www.ponricerca.gov.it/pon-ricerca/programme/) on Research and Innovation 2014-2020 and the European Social Fund (ESF, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/glossary/european-social-fund-esf.html) within the Recovery assistance for cohesion and the territories of Europe (REACT-EU, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/215/recovery-assistance-for-cohesion-and-the-territories-of-europe-react-eu-).
